Dracula theme for [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra)
==============================================================================

This theme leaves a lot to be desired. I have tried to change what I can and will be making updates as possible.

To install copy _code_browser.tcd into ~/.ghidra/.ghidra-VERSION/_code_browser.tcd

Also install [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) as a font.

See [this post](https://gist.github.com/enzinier/8d00d3f37d2e23985dcfa65662d163fa) as an example of how to install Source Code Pro.
